    Fortnite Poem: They call me the Fortnite God
                   When I play everyone Applauds
                   I kill my oponents left and right
                   oh my game is such a delight
                   
                   At the end of the game i am the only one left alive
                   because nobody else is able to survive
                   whether its a scar or an AR I will win  
                   I will look at everyone else as a manakkin  
    
                   I throw on John Wickand everyone is scared
                   I leave all my oponents seriosely impaired
                   building mega-forts is slight work
                   but boy does it look like artwork
                
                   Tacs, RPG's, snipers it doesnt matter
                   I put everyone in the blender
                   wins upon wins upon wins
                   i've unlocked all of the skins!</body>
